let obj = {
	bar:42,
	foo() {
		console.log(this);
	}
}

obj.foo();

/*

Description:
This code defines an object `obj` with two properties: `bar` (set to 42) and a method `foo` that logs `this`.
When `obj.foo()` is called, `this` inside the method refers to the object `obj` because the method is called as a property of `obj`.

Output:
{ bar: 42, foo: [Function: foo] }

Why:
When a method is called on an object (like `obj.foo()`), `this` refers to the object the method is called on. 
In this case, `this` refers to the entire `obj` object, which contains both the `bar` property and the `foo` method.
