/*
  Description:
  This JavaScript code demonstrates how static and instance methods coexist in a class.

  Class A defines:
  - A static method: `foo()` that logs "A"
  - An instance method: `foo()` that logs "B"
  - Another static method: `test()` that calls `this.foo()`

  When `A.test()` is called:
  - Since `test()` is a static method, `this` refers to the class itself (`A`)
  - The class `A` does have a static `foo()` method, so `this.foo()` resolves to `A.foo()`
  - Therefore, the static `foo()` is executed and logs "A" to the console

  Output:
  A

  Explanation:
  Static methods are called on the class itself, not on instances.
  In `test()`, `this.foo()` correctly calls the static version of `foo()`, not the instance one.
