# What Does This Code Output?

This repository contains over 100 small yet tricky JavaScript code snippets that focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and JavaScript-specific behavior.

Each snippet presents a unique challenge:  
**Can you guess what the code will output and why?**  

Let’s test and improve our JavaScript intuition — one snippet at a time.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open any of the JavaScript files in a text editor or IDE.
3. Read the code carefully and predict what it will output.
4. Run the code in your browser’s console or Node.js to check if your prediction was correct.
5. Review the code’s behavior and logic. If you don’t get the expected result, dive deeper into the explanation to understand why.

**Code Explanations:**  
At the end of each code snippet, you'll find a comment explaining the code's behavior, its output, and the reasoning behind it. 
These comments will help you understand the underlying JavaScript concepts and deepen your knowledge of OOP principles and JavaScript-specific behavior.
