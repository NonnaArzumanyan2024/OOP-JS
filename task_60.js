/* 

  This code demonstrates how the `this` keyword behaves when using the `.call()` method 
  to explicitly set the function's execution context.

  1. The object `obj` has a property `x` with the value `42` and a method `fn` that logs `this.x`.
  2. The method is invoked with `obj.fn.call(null)`, which means the `this` context is explicitly set to `null`.
  3. Since the code is not in strict mode, JavaScript replaces `null` with the global object (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js).
  4. The global object likely does not have an `x` property, so `this.x` evaluates to `undefined`.

  Output:
    undefined

  Explanation:
    In non-strict mode, when `null` is passed as the `this` value, JavaScript substitutes it with the global object.
    As a result, `this.x` tries to access the `x` property on the global object, which is likely undefined.
