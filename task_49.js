/*

Description:
This code attempts to assign a value to `this` inside a method, which is not allowed in JavaScript.
`this` is a special keyword that refers to the context object and cannot be reassigned.

Output (in Node.js):
SyntaxError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment expression

Why:
In JavaScript, `this` is not a variable and cannot be the target of an assignment.
Trying to do so results in a syntax error.
